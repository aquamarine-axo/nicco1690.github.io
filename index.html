    <span class="links">I'm some random dude on the internet (he/him and they/them are fine for pronouns) who likes:
    <ul><li>Music</li>
    <li>8 bit systems</li>
    <li>Programming</li>
    <li>Doing various combinaions and variations of those activities</li></ul>
    I have a few software projects going on (almost none are uploaded to github) however in the future, they'll probably be in my repositories and linked here, on this site.</span><br><hr>
    <span style="font-size:22px;"><b>Portfolio</b></span><br>
    <span class="links">I do lots of things with my free time, but here are some of the things that I think I'm best at and I think are noteworthy enough to be included:
    <ul><li>I work in various music software, such as Deflemask, Furnace Tracker, and Famitracker to create covers and original music.</li>
    <li>I am avalible to work on music and graphics for games (however I specialize in retro-styled graphics and music). If you are interested in getting me to work on something for you, please email me.</li>
    <li>I do various programming activities, in languages such as 6502 Assembly and Javascript.</li>
    <li>I'm a semi-active contributor to the Furnace Tracker project, and often help bug test for them.</li>
    <li>I also do web design (not very professionally though, as you can see by the design of this page)</li>
    </ul></span>
