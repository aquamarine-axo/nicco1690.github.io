    <span><i>Here, you'll find:</i> <b>Absolutely nothing of worth.</b> There is next to no reason to visit this page. <br><br>This site is, for now at least, a replacement for my old site that was hosted on Neocities (of which I'm planning to abandon in favor of this) because it was a cheap host and I didn't wanna host anything myself.</span><hr>
    <span class="links">If you're really that desperate to see something out of this page, then see my <a href="https://nicco1690.neocities.org/">old website </a>too.</span>
